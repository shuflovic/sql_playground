A simple, offline SQL training app built with Python and Tkinter.  
Perfect for practicing SQL queries on your local Microsoft SQL Server database without needing the internet or complex tools.

## Features

- **Permanent Snippets Panel**: Favorite queries always visible on the right side. Click to load instantly.
- **Save Current Query as Snippet**: One-click save with overwrite protection.
- **Multiple Result Sets**: Run several SELECT statements at once — each table displays separately with headers.
- **Beautiful Table Formatting**: Aligned columns, clear separators, NULL handling.
- **Fully Offline**: Everything runs locally — no cloud dependencies.
- **Persistent Snippets**: Saved automatically to `snippets.json` in the project folder.
- **Git Ready**: Easy to version-control your progress (see below).

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Microsoft SQL Server (tested with SQL Server 2025 Express)
- pyodbc: `pip install pyodbc`

## Setup

1. **Place the file**  
   Save `sql_gui.py` in a folder of your choice.

2. **Edit the connection string** (if needed)  
   Inside `sql_gui.py`, look for the `conn_str` section around line ~90.  
   It should already work if you're using:
   - SQL Server Express named instance (`localhost\\SQLEXPRESS`)
   - Windows Authentication  
   If you use SQL login or a different server name, adjust accordingly.

3. **Create a test database** (optional but recommended)  
   In SSMS or your app:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE test;
   GO
   USE test;
   -- Add your tables, e.g., flights, workaway_projects, etc.
